# Movie Catalog API

## Description

This project is a RESTful API built using TypeScript, Nest.js, TypeORM, Swagger, Docker, Redis, and PostgreSQL. The main objective is to develop a JWT authentication system and manage a catalog of movies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Configure Redis if applicable.
4. Run `npm run start:dev` to start the development server.

## Viewing All Routes

To view all available routes and endpoints, access the Swagger documentation. If running the application locally, navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/api

Replace `5000` with the port where your Nest.js application is running.

If your application is hosted on a server, use the corresponding domain name or IP address followed by `/api`.

This `/api` path is the default defined by Swagger in Nest.js configuration, but it might vary if you've customized the Swagger path manually.
